# Front End Programming Challenge

### To start
`yarn install`

`yarn dev`

### To run tests
`yarn test:unit`

I did the following features and added unit tests.

1. Create a page with a chessboard and a sidebar.
2. On desktop devices the sidebar should be positioned to the right of the sidebar.
3. On mobile devices the sidebar should be positioned below the chessboard.
4. The chessboard should resize responsively to consume available space.
5. Clicking a chessboard square should highlight the square.
6. Keep track of which squares are clicked and the order in which they're clicked.
7. Display the information collected from step 6 in the sidebar.
